# 2022 Imposter Detector
This project uses Google's App Engine to convert speech to text and detect sus audio. Pydub adds a funni vine boom sound effect every time there is a sus trigger word.
The website uses ReactJS and records audio, processes it, and returns the sussified audio clip. 
It also has some animated crewmate flare and pictures of the Rock to reinforce the sus detector.
